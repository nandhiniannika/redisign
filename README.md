# Memorae Redesign (React + TailwindCSS)

This is a starter React (Vite) project that reimagines the memorae.ai website.
It includes:
- React (Vite)
- TailwindCSS
- Framer Motion for animations

## Quick start

1. unzip and open folder:
   ```bash
   cd memorae-redesign
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

Enjoy! If you want me to:
- add routing,
- convert to Next.js,
- add real data or sample CMS,
- or produce a short video walkthrough / README script,
tell me and I will modify the project.
